Wrapped with the "withList" and "withCurrentUser" containers.

#tutorial-step-11 -
Now, we are going to look at this in a bit more detail.
This component is a React component. We only have one but it does a bunch of things...

// #tutorial-step-12 - Well. that's it! If you like this, go on to the movies-example, where we get more granular when it comes to data loading.
